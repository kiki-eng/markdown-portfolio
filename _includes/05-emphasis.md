I am a committed, hardworking and reliable Software Engineer with a strong software/engineering background and a positive attitude to challenges and opportunities. I have previously worked in busy, fast-paced and challenging environments with a track record of introducing improved methods of software skill, resulting in increased operational efficiency. I take ownership of my tasks, and Iâ€™m willing to go the extra mile to deliver and exceed expectations where possible. My current job role involve flip learning in several areas; therefore prioritising my work activities is a key strength that I have developed.
